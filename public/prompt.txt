Please convert the data from this image into a CSV format. Do not include rows that have blank values for all columns. Do not make assumptions about numerical values, just convert exactly as seen. Pay close attention to whether there is decimal points or not on the numeric values. You can make assumptions for words given context and convert them to the most likely value if uncertain. For each column add a column with the name of the column appended with uncertainty directly after each respective column. For each row in this column indicate boolean values of true or false indicating your uncertainty of the value analyzed for each row. Note any genuine uncertainty about a value in the output. Place a --CSV-END-- delimiter between the csv output and notes.
