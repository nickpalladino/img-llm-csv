Please convert the data from this image into a CSV format. Do not include rows that have blank values for all columns. Carefully examine each value, paying attention to the context and any potential issues. If a value seems inconsistent, consider the possibility of misinterpretation before concluding it's an outlier. Double-check for visual ambiguities that could lead to misinterpretation. If an apparent outlier could have a reasonable explanation based on context, do not exclude or modify it. For each column add a column with the name of the column appended with uncertainty directly after each respective column. For each row in this column indicate boolean values of true or false indicating your uncertainty of the value analyzed for each row. Note any genuine uncertainty about a value in the output, but do not attempt to correct or predict uncertain values without high confidence. Place a --CSV-END-- delimiter between the csv output and notes.
